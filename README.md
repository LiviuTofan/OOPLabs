# LabsOOP
My laboratory works for the Object Oriented Programming University course

# [Labs1OOP](https://github.com/LiviuTofan/OOPLabs/tree/main/Lab1)
This laboratory work was aimed on working with the basics of the Object Oriented Paradigm. It involved just creating two simple classes.

# [University Management Project](https://github.com/LiviuTofan/OOPLabs/tree/main/Lab2)
This lab was about creting a system that would allow the management of a University, including faculties, each having multiple student groups and each student group having multiple students.
The task was to make it work errorless and to mantain a good logic of the programm, involving multiple objects communicating between each other.

# [Toretto](https://github.com/LiviuTofan/OOPLabs/tree/main/Lab3)
Toretto was about creating a similar to git system, where you can initalize different Rettositories on your PC locally and track if some files were changed, deleted or added.
The commands are very similar to git, like init, commit, you can remove a rettository or
delete a file from it. It tracks the changes into files, when change occurs, in console is printed file name + changed.

# [StacksAndQueue](https://github.com/LiviuTofan/OOPLabs/tree/main/Lab4)
This lab was about creating generic classes to implement the Stack, Queue, Linked List and Array data structures. Also to create two interfaces one for Queue and another one for Stack.
For the Queue and Stack, there is also an implementation were they use Linked List Node.
